### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ha My, you can call me Maya. I'm a student pursuing an MSc in Investment Analysis at Aston University. I code for the purpose of both working professionally and my own interest. I use Python most of the time. 

I have so much to learn, and I have felt so excited about this journey ever since I started it. I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and leveraging them to solve real-life problems. Feel free to reach me out!
